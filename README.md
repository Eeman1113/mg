## ‚ú® Features

  - **Weasel Word Detection**: Flags words that are ambiguous and weaken your statements (e.g., "many", "extremely", "very").
  - **Passive Voice Detection**: Identifies sentences written in the passive voice, helping you write in a more direct and active style.
  - **Duplicate Word Check**: Catches accidental word repetitions (e.g., "the the").
  - **Spelling Check**: Points out common spelling mistakes.
  - **Colored Output**: Uses terminal colors to clearly distinguish suggestions and errors.

## ‚öôÔ∏è Installation

To use `mg`, you need to have Rust and Cargo installed on your system. If you don't have them, you can install them from [rustup.rs](https://rustup.rs/).

1.  **Clone the repository:**

    ```bash
    git clone https://github.com/Eeman1113/mg.git
    cd mg
    ```

2.  **Build the project:**
    For the best performance, build the project in release mode.

    ```bash
    cargo build --release
    ```

3.  **Install the binary (Optional):**
    To make the `writing-checker` binary available anywhere in your system, you can install it using Cargo:

    ```bash
    cargo install --path .
    ```

## üöÄ Usage

The tool is run from your terminal. The binary name is `writing-checker`.

If you installed it using `cargo install`, you can run it directly:

```bash
writing-checker <path/to/your/file.txt>
```

If you built it with `cargo build`, you can run it through Cargo:

```bash
cargo run --release -- <path/to/your/file.txt>
```

### Example

Let's say you have a file named `mydoc.txt` with the following content:

```
This is a very interesting document. A solution was discovered by the the team. Many people agree that this is quite significant.
```

Run the checker on this file:

```bash
writing-checker mydoc.txt
```

The output will look something like this, with colors highlighting the issues:

```markdown
